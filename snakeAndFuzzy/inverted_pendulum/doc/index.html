<title>Inverted pendulum controlled by a fuzzy system</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Inverted pendulum controlled by a fuzzy system</h1>
This is an example of a fuzzy system to control an inverted
pendulum.
<h2>What is an inverted pendulum</h2>
For the general description of an inverted pendulum, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_pendulum">Wikipedia.</a>
<p>Also there are several examples of real world inverted pendulums
to find at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=inverted+pendulum">YouTube</a> or <a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=inverted+pendulum">Google Video</a>.</p>
<h2>General structure</h2>
The whole system consists of a simulated inverted pendulum which
current state is feed into a controller. Its result is then used
to control the acceleration of the base of the inverted pendulum.
<p>To show off some features of pyfuzzy the controller is realized using a fuzzy system.
(However, one can also realize other types of controllers, as an example there is included a neural network as controller.)

inverted pendulum.</li>

Ren&eacute; Liebscher for several lectures in study)</li>

<h2>History</h2>
This system was written orginally in Delphi for purpose to gain some
experience in some topics taught in Ren&eacute; Liebscher's study
of computer science. This work is still available at <a href=

(In German)
<p>Later when creating pyfuzzy it was converted to python, to serve
here as an example.</p>
