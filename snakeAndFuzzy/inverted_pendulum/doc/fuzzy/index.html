<h1>A fuzzy system to control an inverted pendulum</h1>
<h2>Input variables</h2>
<h3>input variable Phi</h3>
<p>This is the angle of the inverted pendulum. It defined as 0 the
pendulum is horizontal to the right, and increasing counter
clockwise.</p>
<p><img src="Phi.png" /></p>
<h3>input variable dPhi-dT</h3>
<p>The angle velocity.</p>
<p><img src="dPhi_dT.png" /></p>
<h3>input variable X</h3>
<p>The absolute position. At the end the pendulum should be
positioned at 0.</p>
<p><img src="X.png" /></p>
<h3>input variable dX-dT</h3>
<p>Velocity of the pendulum.</p>
<p><img src="dX_dT.png" /></p>
<h2>Output variables</h2>
<h3>output variable a</h3>
<p>The acceleration of base point of the pendulum. This is the
output of the fuzzy controller.</p>

<h2>Fuzzy rules</h2>
<p>They might be more complex than necessary, but there intend is
also some features of pyfuzzy.</p>
<p>If you like you can change them by yourself.</p>
<h3>Stabilizing the pendulum upright</h3>
If the pendulum is almost upright we should stabilize it there and
try to lead it to position 0.
<h4>stop</h4>
<p>If the pendulum is upright and we don't move, or it is not
upright but turns in the right direction to become upright, we
should stop moving.</p>

<h4>tilts left</h4>
<p>If the pendulum is tilted left we should also move left, but for
reaching position 0 we supress this when the position is somewhere
at the right of position 0. So we hold an slight left tilting which
is followed until we reaching position near 0.</p>

<h4>tilts right</h4>
<p>If the pendulum is tilted right we should also move right, but
for reaching position 0 we supress this when the position is
somewhere at the left of position 0. So we hold an slight right
tilting which is followed until we reaching position near 0.</p>

<h4>far left</h4>
<p>If the pendulum is tilted more left we should move left in any
case, without any considerations about position.</p>

<h4>far right</h4>
<p>If the pendulum is tilted more right we should move right in any
case, without any considerations about position.</p>

<h3>Handling a downwards hanging pendulum</h3>
<h4>accelerate counter clockwise if down</h4>
<p>If the pendulum is hanging down, ....</p>

<h4>accelerate clockwise if down</h4>
<p>If the pendulum is hanging down, ....</p>
<p><img src="Rule%20accelerate%20cw%20if%20down.png" /></p>
<h2>Result</h2>
<h3>a as function of Phi and dPhi_dT</h3>
<p>Without considering position control, you get the following
function:</p>
